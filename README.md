The [**Trojan Crypto Trading Bot**](https://x.solvault.ws) is a [site-based automated trading platform](https://x.solvault.ws) designed for the Solana blockchain, leveraging its high-speed transactions and low fees. It enables users to execute trades, snipe new tokens, and automate strategies directly within Telegram, making it accessible for both novice and experienced traders. Originally a rebrand of Unibot on Solana, Trojan has grown into a leading tool with over 500,000 users and a lifetime trading volume exceeding $16 billion as of 2025.
